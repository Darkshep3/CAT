CAT - Chemistry Alert Tool ????
Because chemistry deadlines shouldn’t sneak up on you like a pop quiz.
And because every email is better with a cat GIF and a random science fact.

What is CAT?
CAT (Chemistry Alert Tool) is a cheerful Python-based email reminder system that:
* ??? Sends HTML emails with personalized countdowns to deadlines
* ?? Embeds cat GIFs and random science facts to keep things fun
* ?? Supports different reminder types (early, mid, final) with themed content
Originally built to support all Honors Chemistry classes in 2024 — now ready to help you too!

?? What’s Inside?
* main.py – the brain of the operation
* splashtext.txt – your arsenal of random facts
* allcats.txt – a lovingly curated list of cat GIFs
* cat_pics/ – where the cats live
* reminder.bat – optional batch file if you want to automate it with Task Scheduler

Setup Instructions
1. Install Python and Libraries
Make sure Python is installed. Libraries used include:
o openpyxl
o smtplib
o datetime
o random
2. Set Up Your Email (Important!)
o Use an email provider with SMTP access (e.g., Gmail or Outlook)
o Enable SMTP or generate an app password if using Gmail (usually requires 2FA)
3. Customize the Batch File (Optional)
o Open reminder.bat
o Point to your Python executable and the correct folder
o This lets you schedule reminders to run on their own
4. Use Windows Task Scheduler (Optional but Cool)
Automate the script daily, weekly, or whenever the cat demands it.

?? Tips and Notes
* ? Update the Excel file (flash_news.xlsx) with your recipient names, emails, and due dates
* ?? If a GIF doesn’t load... it’s probably a shy cat, give it time
* ?? Science facts are for entertainment — not necessarily peer-reviewed!
