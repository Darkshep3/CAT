CAT - Chemistry Alert Tool ðŸ˜º 

What is CAT?
CAT (Chemistry Alert Tool) is a Python-based email reminder system that:
Sends HTML emails with personalized countdowns to deadlines
Embeds cat GIFs and random science facts to keep things fun
Originally built as a troll passion project for my Honors Chemistry Class 2024 to reminder people of deadlines

Setup Instructions
1. Install Python and Libraries
Make sure Python is installed. Libraries used include:
openpyxl
smtplib
datetime
random

2. Set Up Your Email
Use an email provider with SMTP access (e.g., Gmail or Outlook)
Enable SMTP or generate an app password if using Gmail (usually requires 2FA)

3. Replace the email and passwords in send_email to the proper ones

4. Customize the Batch File (Optional)
Open CAT.bat
Point to your Python executable and the correct folder
This lets you schedule reminders to run on their own

5. Use Windows Task Scheduler (Optional but Cool)
Automate the script daily, weekly, or whenever the cat demands it.
